                            Cultural tourism is the most significant type of
                            tourism in South Sudan. So far we take tourists to
                            some of the most prominent tribes whose cultures are
                            still authentic. These tribes include Mundari,
                            Dinka, Boya (Laarim), Toposa, Jie, Lotuko, Lopit,
                            Kachipo and Murle. In addition to the above tribes,
                            we are in the process of organizing tours to two of
                            the only three existing kingdoms in South Sudan â€“
                            The Shilluk and Azande kingdoms.{" "}

                            At the moment we conduct tours to Boma and Nimule
                            National Parks. We also carryout expeditions to the
                            Sudd, Kinyeti Mountain and Jebel Kujur, west of
                            Juba. A boat cruise on the mighty Nile will
                            definitely add meaning to your vacation.
